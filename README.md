## Next Steps

### Improve the precision of the current features
Currently, my features of stock overview and analysis reply on criteria and threshold, which are simple and rough. To make the output more reliable and the signal more precise, I plan to improve the precisions of the criteria and threshold if any, including:
* Enrich the survey questions to make the scoring and the invester type more accurate.
* Improve the criteria of technical indicators:
    * SMA: Adding the time series chart, "Support & Resistance" and "Crossovers".
    * RSI: Adding more period for reference, like 20 and 60 day period.
* Improve the criteria of fundamental indicators:
    * PE: Adding more reliable parameter like trailing EPS to determine a more accurate PE.
* Adjust the criteria of news sentiment signal:
    * Sentiment Label: differenciate the "Somewhat Bullish/Bearish" and "Bullish/Bearish".

### Extend the features of the stock analysis
Currently, my features of stock overview and analysis include limited funtionalities with simple signals for investors. To help investors improve their decision-making, I plan to add more features to make the analysis more informative and straightforward:
* Add more technical indicators and determine the overall BUY/SELL signal:
    * By adding more indicators like KDJ, MACD, etc, determine the overall signal based on a comprehensive weighted average bullish/bearish sentiment of each technical indicator.
* Make overview fundamental indicators concise and add more company value dimensions:
    * Exclude the overview index that are less relevant to decision-making, such as shares outstanding.
    * Add PS, PB for for reference in company value, in addtion to PE, if possible, find sources for industry average value so that the comparison would be more meaningful.

### Enrich the customization funtionalities
Currently, the configuration of the tailored stock overview page and the stock comparison page is set by default based on the developer's setting (average consensus). To improve user experience, I plan to make the following adjustments:
* The page should allow the user to customize the interface and show/hide the indicators and analysis according to their needs.
* Add a favourite stock list feature for users to better keep tracking of the stocks.

### Optimize the visualization of the interface
Currently, the interface of each page is simple and plain. I plan to optimize the visulization by introducing some third party components to make the interface, texts and charts more professional and readable.
